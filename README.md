# Music Theory

A tool for music theory and guitar/fretboard visualization.

[Live version](https://music-theory-lac.vercel.app/)

## Why?

I've been hacking on this slowly for a bit. It started as a way to visualize scales for myself.
This became more important after I switched from standard tuning to fourths tuning.
I also couldn't find any good open source tools so I decided to make this one with the intention of making it open source.

## Vision?

Eventually I'd like this to be a complete set of tools for any stringed-instrument player.

## Technical stuff

This project uses Svelte/Typescript. I've been thinking about trying to port this over to clojurescript for a while.
Actually the first thing I did was implement a clojure-inspired sequence abstraction. Although it's pretty terrible.
Clojurescript (and potentially datascript) would just give me a ton of tools to implement other features.
